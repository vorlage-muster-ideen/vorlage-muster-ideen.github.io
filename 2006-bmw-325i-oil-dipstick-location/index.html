<p><strong>2006 Bmw 325i Oil Dipstick Location</strong>. The company recommends using synthetic 5W-30 oil with all oil changes. The blower resistor on the 1992 BMW 325i is located under the center console. I love this car to death after owning it for about 2 weeks now. Note that most BMW have an oil pressure gauge next to the speedometer - this gauge does not tell you what your oil level is however the video above will show you how check the oil level in your 2006 BMW 325i.</p>

<p>Where is the dip stick in this car - 2006 BMW. If he is kidding but I can not believe that saving a few dollars in costs by eliminating as critical a device as an oil dipstick is something that BMW would even consider. I found the transmission dipstick i think but im not sure either. 1162008 Alsothe difference on BMWs dipsticks is that they picked a color that after so many years has turned an identical color to the oil and has no markings that explain things. Advance Auto Parts has 2 different Engine Oil Dipstick for your vehicle ready for shipping or in-store pick up. When it comes to your BMW 325i you want parts and products from only trusted brands.</p>

<p>Check the oil level using the dipstick in the engine you may just have a bad sensor that needs to be repaced however if it is in fact getting low you may want to have the engine checked for comprssion leaks you may be burning the oil or it is seeping out of the gaskets in small amounts.</p>
